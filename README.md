just a quick experiment to stream things on `excalidraw` using `gpto` with `vercel/ai` lib

example use case that could be useful:
- new kind of web which is 100% generative UI on infinite canvas
- look at your screen and create decision tree, maps, diagrams, of your doings, decisions, sales, crm, etc
- help you think faster using visual thinking
- connect your drawings by semantic (e.g. embeddings thing) like obsidian a bit but for excalidraw
- cursor.sh meet excalidraw.com
- etc.
