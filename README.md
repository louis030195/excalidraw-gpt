just a quick experiment to stream things on `excalidraw.com` using `gpto` with `vercel/ai` lib using a `cursor.com` like UX

example use case that could be useful:
- perplexity.ai in a canvas 
- web in general 100% generative UI on infinite canvas
- automatically generate maps of your thoughts based on your notes on the side
- help you think differently using visual thinking, seeing the big picture quickly or different resolutions (think like Google Maps but 100% generative UI at different resolutions)
- connect your drawings by semantic (e.g. embeddings thing) like obsidian a bit but for excalidraw
- cursor.sh meet excalidraw.com
- etc.


### usage 

atm you need to run it on your computer like so, first clone the repo and then:

create .env and add your openai key to it like in .env.example


```bash
pnpm i 
pnpm dev
```


go to localhost:3000 and you can start drawing
