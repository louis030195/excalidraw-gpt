just a quick experiment to stream things on excalidraw using `gpto` 

example use case:
- look at your screen and create decision tree, maps, diagrams, of your doings, decisions, sales, crm, etc
- help you think faster using visual thinking
- connect your drawings by semantic (e.g. embeddings thing) like obsidian a bit but for excalidraw
- cursor.sh meet excalidraw.com
- etc.
